# Reframing

This document defines how the system helps users recover lost ideas through reframing.

---

## Definition

**Reframing** is the act of presenting an existing idea in a new context or format to trigger recognition or understanding.

---

## Reframing Strategies

### 1. Simplification
**Action:** Rewrite the idea using simpler vocabulary or shorter sentence structure (temporarily).
**Example:**
- Original: "Mitochondria generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation."
- Reframed: "Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell."

### 2. Exemplification
**Action:** Show an example instead of the definition.
**Example:**
- Original: "Gravity is the force of attraction between mass."
- Reframed: "Gravity is what makes the apple fall from the tree."

### 3. Contextual Connection
**Action:** Show the idea in relation to its neighbors.
**Example:**
- Original: "Magna Carta signed in 1215."
- Reframed: "This event happened right before the Baron's War and limited the King's power."

## Constraints

- **Meaning Preservation:** The core truth of the idea must NEVER be changed.
- **Temporary View:** Reframing is visual only. It does not overwrite the stored idea text unless the user explicitly chooses to "Update to this version."

> **Goal:** If the front door is locked (direct recall), try the side window (reframing).
