# Contextual Assembly

This document defines how retrieved ideas are presented to the user.

## Logical Ordering

Random lists are useless. Retrieved ideas must be assembled into a coherent flow.

### 1. Hierarchy First
- Present **General Concepts** (Definitions) before **Specifics** (Examples/Data).
- Present **Causes** before **Effects**.

### 2. Grouping
- Group ideas by their Relationship type to the query.
  - *Definitions:* [Idea A]
  - *Supporting Evidence:* [Idea B, Idea C]
  - *Counter-points:* [Idea D]

## Preservation of Text

**Critical Rule:** The Assembly process organizes *existing* atomic ideas. It does **not** rewrite them into a new paragraph unless explicitly requested (Synthesis).
- **UI:** Render the original "Idea Cards" in the determined order.
- **Why?** Preserves provenance and trust. User recognizes their own words.

## Narrative Bridges

The system may insert lightweight "bridge text" between groups:
- *"Here is the core definition:"*
- *"This is supported by:"*
- *"However, note this contradiction:"*

---

> **Principle:** Coherence without hallucination.
