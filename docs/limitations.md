# Known Limitations (v1)

This document outlines the known limitations of brain-database-app in its initial release. These are documented for transparency and to set clear expectations for users and developers.

---

## Performance

- **Performance may vary on low-end machines** — Local AI inference and data processing are resource-intensive. Users with older or less powerful hardware may experience slower response times.

---

## Sync & Portability

- **No cross-device sync in v1** — Data is stored locally on a single device. Users must manually export/import to transfer data between devices.

---

## Platform Support

- **No mobile optimization in v1** — The interface is designed for desktop browsers. Mobile layouts and touch interactions are not prioritized in this release.

---

## Collaboration

- **No real-time collaboration** — This is a single-user application. Multi-user editing, sharing, or collaborative features are not supported.

---

## Visualization & Analytics

- **Graph visualizations and advanced analytics are optional for later versions** — v1 focuses on core functionality. Visual knowledge graphs, statistical dashboards, and analytics tools may be added in future releases.

---

## Recall Behavior

- **Explicit recall requires user attention** — Recall sessions are user-initiated and require active engagement. There is no automatic background recall, spaced repetition notifications, or passive review system.

---

> **Note:** These limitations are intentional for v1 to maintain focus, simplicity, and adherence to the project's hard constraints. Future versions may address some of these based on user feedback and development capacity.
